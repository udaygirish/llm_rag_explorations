The increase in revenues was primarily driven by Google Services and Google Cloud. The adverse effect of COVID-19 on 2020 advertising revenues also contributed to the year-over-year growth.\\n\\n● Cost of revenues was $110.9 billion, an increase of 31%, primarily driven by increases in TAC and content acquisition costs.\\n\\n● An overall increase in data centers and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment. • Operating expenses were $68.0 billion, an increase of 20%, primarily driven by headcount growth, increases in advertising and promotional expenses and charges related to legal matters.\\n\\nOther information:\\n\\n● Operating cash flow was $91.7 billion, primarily driven by revenues generated from our advertising products.\\n\\n● Share repurchases were $50.3 billion, an increase of 62%. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\\n\\n● Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $24.6 billion.\\n\\n● In January 2021, we updated the useful lives of certain of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of $2.6 billion recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D.

Our Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since August 19, 2004 and under the symbol \"GOOGL\" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B common stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C capital stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.\\n\\nHolders of Record\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 4,907 and 1,733 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, respectively. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 64 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.\\n\\nDividend Policy\\n\\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.\\n\\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\n\\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet\\'s repurchases of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2021:\\n\\nTotal Number of Approxi Shares lar Value of Purchased Shares that Total Number of Total Numberof A\\\\ Price Ai Price Partof Publicly Yet Be Purchased A Shares Inder Purchased Purchased ClassA Share Class C Share Programs Period (in thousands) \"(in thousands) \"’ bl _*___{inthousands)\" __(in millions) _ October 1 - 31 126 1,445 $ 2,812.76 $ 2,794.72 1.571 § 26,450 November 1 - 30 289 1,393 $ 2,943.97 $ 2,956.73 1,682 $ 21,479 December 1 - 31 250 1,169 $ 2,880.79 $ 2,898.56 1,419 $ 17,371 Total 665 4,007 4,672 () The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.
